# GVG-AI-2015
Watch out other contestants! INI participates at this year's GVG-AI competition and we are going to win! With the least amount of effort, because that is what we mainly optimize for.

To set up a GVG-AI Development environment on your machine, refer to the following article in our wiki:

You are always welcome to improve the article and add new ones (that is the idea of a wiki compared to a non-editable documentation).
