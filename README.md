# GVG-AI-2015
Watch out other contestants! INI participates at this year's GVG-AI competition and we are going to win! With the least amount of effort, because that is what we mainly optimize for.

If you are new to this group and you are wondering what we did up to now, here is our schedule:
* [Past Meetings and Future Schedule](https://github.com/benelot/GVG-AI-2015/wiki/Past-Meetings-and-Future-Schedule)


--------

## Setup:

To set up a GVG-AI Development environment on your machine, refer to the following article in our wiki:

* [Setup GVG-AI Development Environment](https://github.com/underworldguardian/GVG-AI-2015/wiki/Setup-GVG-AI-Development-Environment)


## Tutorials:

Once you have everything installed and working according to the setup above, let's get started.  Head over to the wiki and proceed with our tutorials:
* [Tutorial 1 - Choosing a Movement](https://github.com/benelot/GVG-AI-2015/wiki/Tutorial-1%3A-Choosing-a-Movement)
* [Tutorial 2 - Reinforcement learning] (https://github.com/benelot/GVG-AI-2015/wiki/Tutorial-2%3A-Reinforcement-Learning)


You are always welcome to improve the article and add new ones (that is the idea of a wiki compared to a non-editable documentation).
